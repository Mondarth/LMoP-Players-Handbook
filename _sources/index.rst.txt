Lost Mines of Phandelver
========================


.. danger:: I recently uncovered a problem using the Vivaldi browser (version 7.3.3635.7 (Stable channel) (x86_64)) with this campaign. While it all still works some scenes will run very slowly.

   The following browsers seem to work fine:
   
   - Brave Version 1.76.80 Chromium: 134.0.6998.118 (Official Build) (x86_64)
   - Google Crome Version 133.0.6943.55 (Official Build) (x86_64)
   - Firefox 137.0 (64bit)

This is a brief handbook for players in the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign run by Markus. It covers some features of the VTT that may be new to players\ [#F1]_.

.. [#F1]  Obviously if you are new to Foundry then *all* features will be new, but I use a lot of automation that may be new to even experienced Foundry users.
