Table
=====

Etiquette
---------

Please be on time! The session will start at the asigned time with or without you (as with other requests this is to be fair to other players).

At the table please:

#. Ensure you are ready when it is your turn to take action.

   If you take too long taking an action you will lose that turn as it's unfair to other players to have to wait too long. (The length of time we wait gets shorter as the campaing progesses.)
#. In combat pay attention even if it not your turn.

   The system may alert you to an opportunity attack or some other special action your character can take. These are time sensitive and if you miss them they are gone.
#. If you are eating/drinking please mute your microphone.

   If fact, mute whenever you are not talking if possible.
#. Let other players play their own character. By all means offer occasional advice but *DO NOT* pressure others to play 'your way'.
#. *DO NOT* :term:`metagame <Meta-gaming>` (I will let you know if you do this accidentally but do not do it deliberately, it's rude).


Character Death

.. important:: This is *ALWAYS* a possibility!
